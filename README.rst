.. start_penaltymodel_about

One approach to solve a constraint satisfaction problem
(`CSP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem>`_) using
an `Ising model <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model>`_ or a
`QUBO <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_unconstrained_binary_optimization>`_,
is to map each individual constraint in the CSP to a 'small' Ising model or
QUBO. This mapping is called a *penalty model*.
