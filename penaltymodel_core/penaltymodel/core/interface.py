"""penaltymodel provides functionality for accessing PenaltyModel factories.

Accessing Factories
-------------------

Any factories that have been identified through the :const:`FACTORY_ENTRYPOINT` entrypoint
and installed on the python path can be accessed through the :func:`get_penalty_model`
function.

Examples:
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> import dimod
    >>> graph = nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> decision_variables = (0, 4)  # the ends of the path
    >>> feasible_configurations = {(-1, -1), (1, 1)}  # we want the ends of the path to agree
    >>> spec = pm.Specification(graph, decision_variables, feasible_configurations, dimod.SPIN)
    >>> widget = pm.get_penalty_model(spec)
